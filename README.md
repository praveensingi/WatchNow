# IS7024_Project
## Introduction
### Overview
We will be making a movie search application. Users can search for a movie and see its poster along with additional details about the movie like cast, director, and ratings. We'll also allow the users to see a trending list of popular movies.  

### Purpose
The web application is to provide users with the ability to enter a movie title and retrieve information about that film. The scope on a movie can be narrowed by entering specific attributes about a film into the form. These attributes could be genre, year, director, and/or cast members.  

### Scope
The details of the movie that will be provided will include:
- Title
- Year
- Director
- Writer(s)
- Rating
- Time
- Genre
- Cast Members
- Awards
- Poster
- Storyline
- Link to Stream/Purchase
